# FileSimilarityMeasure
Text-based similarity measure through Jaccard, Jaro Winkler, Longest Common Subsequence, and Fuzzy Score
The program prompts for a directory, file extension, and name filters. The program compares all files matching the name and extension filter, including those within the subdirectories (Deep scan). Each file is compared against all others using the text similarity measures Jaccard, Jaro Winkler, Longest Common Subsequence, and Fuzzy Score. Currently, the program is CLI but plan to add a GUI component.
